```javascript
// Main application routes
/blocks                                    // Homepage with latest blocks
/blocks/block/:blockNumber                 // Individual block details
/blocks/block/:blockNumber/txs             // Individual block transactions
/blocks/block/:blockNumber/txns/:txnHash   // Transaction details page
/account                                   // Layout page for account with search input
/account/:address                          // Account balance and historical transactions
/*                                         // 404 Not Found page
```

## ‚ö° Alchemy SDK Integration

- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket connections for live updates

### Alchemy Features Used
```javascript
// Core SDK features implemented
- alchemy.core.getBlock()                    // Block data with enhanced metadata
- alchemy.core.getTransaction()              // Transaction details with gas optimization
- alchemy.core.getBlockNumber()              // Get latest block number
- alchemy.core.getBlockWithTransactions()    // Block data with transactions
- alchemy.core.getBalance()                  // Get account balance
- alchemy.core.getAssetTransfers()           // Get account historical transactions
```

### SDK Configuration
```javascript
// Example Alchemy SDK setup
import { Alchemy, Network } from 'alchemy-sdk';

const config = {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY,
  network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
  maxRetries: 3,
  requestTimeout: 30000
};

const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);
```
